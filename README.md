I'm just starting to learn C++ and linked lists has given me a chance to challenge myself.
THIS CODE IS NOT AN EFFICIENT CODE IN ANYWAY.
This is the result of me trying to create my own code (methods) on how to manipulate a singly linked list without looking into someone else's code. To add to the challenge, TAIL is is also maintained during manipulation of the list.

methods are:
  addNode     - add a node at the start of the list.
  appendNode  - add a node at the end of the list.
  insertNodeA - inserts a node after a target node.
  insertNodeB - inserts a node before a target node.
  deleteNode  - deletes a node.
  listNode    - displays the node in the console.
  sortNode    - sorts the list in ascending order. To make it a bit challenging for me, I sorted it by chaging the NEXT pointer instead of swapping the actual data stored in the node. 
  
  All methods ensures head and tails points at the proper nodes (or at least I tried).
  Memory clean-up is also attempted (but i'm not sure if I really did cleaned up the heap properly).
